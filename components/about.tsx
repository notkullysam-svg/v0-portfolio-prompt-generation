          <p>
            I'm a full stack developer passionate about creating solutions that make a real difference in people's
            lives. My journey started with a simple belief: technology can bridge the gap between communities and the
            services they deserve.
          </p>

          <p>
            With expertise in Python, C++, and SQL, I combine strong backend fundamentals with modern web development
            practices. I love turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly applications that solve actual pain
            points.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fix It Force is my flagship projectâ€”a platform born from frustration with infrastructure neglect. It
            represents my commitment to civic tech and creating tools that hold systems accountable while empowering
            citizens.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies, thinking about how to make systems more transparent,
            and dreaming up the next big idea that could improve communities.
